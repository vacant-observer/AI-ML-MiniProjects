# AI and Machine Learning Mini-Projects

## About Me
Hello! I have a growing passion for AI and machine learning. This repository is a collection of small projects that demonstrate my journey and skills in these exciting fields.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in AI and machine learning. Each project here is designed to showcase different aspects of AI/ML, from basic implementations to more complex applications.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Gymnasium Environment Explorer](./gymnasium-environment-explorer)
- A GUI application for exploring and interacting with Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) environments
- Technologies used: Python, Tkinter, Gymnasium
- Features:
  - Real-time search functionality for Gymnasium environments
  - Detailed display of environment specifications, including action space, observation space, and reward range
  - Interactive and responsive GUI
  - Custom key mapping for playing supported environments
  - Support for no-op actions in playable environments
- Learned about:
  - Reinforcement learning environments and their structure
  - GUI development with Tkinter
  - Working with the Gymnasium library
  - Handling complex data structures in Python
  - Implementing custom dialog boxes and user input handling
  - Using Gymnasium's play utility for environment interaction

### [Project 2: Name of Second Project] (Coming Soon)
