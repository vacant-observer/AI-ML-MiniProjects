# AI and Machine Learning Mini-Projects

## About Me
Hello! I have a growing passion for AI and machine learning. This repository is a collection of small projects that demonstrate my journey and skills in these exciting fields.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in AI and machine learning. Each project here is designed to showcase different aspects of AI/ML, from basic implementations to more complex applications.

## Projects
